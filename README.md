Small program to resize all the images in a folder


I was working on creating a new website for my shop, and needed to upload about 450 pictures for all the different products. I also had to resize them so that they didn't take up all the space on the server. Rather than doing all of that by hand, I looked up a way to do it with python. I borrowed some code from differnt sources and put it together to get a program that I used. 

I set the default values to cut the dimensions in half. This worked well in my case because the images were very large to begin with. My pictures started out at around 3000x2000 pixels and 4 mb each. So by cutting it in half, I wound up with an image that was about 1500x1000px. Big enough for images on a website.
